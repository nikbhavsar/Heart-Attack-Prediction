## 1. Project Overview
## Problem Area

### The Growing Crisis of Heart Disease
Heart disease is a leading cause of death in Canada, yet **1 in 3 cases go undiagnosed** until severe symptoms emerge. Delayed detection often leads to irreversible damage, increased healthcare costs, and preventable fatalities. With **14 Canadian adults dying every hour** from heart disease (CCDSS 2017â€“2018), early risk assessment is critical.

### Barriers to Care
- **Doctor shortages**: 4.7 million Canadians lack a family physician ([2023 Statistics Canada](https://www.statcan.gc.ca)).
- **Limited awareness**: Many dismiss early warning signs like high blood pressure or cholesterol.
- **Testing gaps**: Rural/remote communities often lack diagnostic facilities.

## Proposed Data Science Solution
Machine learning can look for patterns in health data and predict if someone is at risk of heart disease. For example, based on data like high glucose or cholesterol
levels, it can show if the user might need medical attention.

## 3. Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning
- Visualized feature distributions and relationships using graphs and plots.
- Look into the dataset for inconsistencies and missing values.
- Removed null values and handled outliers appropriately.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using **OneHotEncoder** and **OrdinalEncoder**.
- Scaled numerical variables to ensure consistent ranges across features.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- Conducted hypothesis testing to validate assumptions.

### 4. Baseline Model
- Built a **Logistic Regression** model as the baseline for initial performance evaluation.
